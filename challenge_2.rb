# Line 1 effectively copy-pastes in any code you wrote in challenge_1.rb
# It's similar to connecting an external stylesheet to an HTML file.
# So if you've already implemented the pmt method over there, then you don't have to rewrite it here.

# Below is an array of hashes. Each hash in the array represents one rate quote from a bank.

loan_quotes = [
  { "bank" => "Elm Street Bank", "rate" => 0.013},
  { "bank" => "Oak Street Bank", "rate" => 0.009},
  { "bank" => "Ash Street Bank", "rate" => 0.011}
]

# Given some parameters of the loan, perhaps entered by a user on a web form:

number_of_payments = 180
principal_amount = 100000.0

# Now, loop through the array of loan quotes using .each:
#   For each option, tell the user how much the monthly payment will be to that bank.
#   Re-use the pmt method that you defined in Challenge 1.

loan_quotes.each do |quote|
  puts "Your monthly payment with #{quote["bank"]} will be #{pmt((quote["rate"]), number_of_payments, principal_amount)}."
end
